        Vinh Quang Models (shortly VQ) is one of the first companies in Vietnam to produce model airplanes. Vinh Quang Models has been in business since 1994. We are a RC model manufactory and our models are all made in-house. Since the beginning, our company was built for one reason only and that is our passion for "Model Airplanes", not just simply a business of selling goods.
